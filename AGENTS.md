## Project Overview

This is the web UI for [jupyter-k8s](https://github.com/jupyter-infra/jupyter-k8s). It's a standalone repo with a React + Vite frontend and a Bun TypeScript backend that talks to the Kubernetes API server using the user's OIDC token.

The only coupling to the main repo is the `workspace.jupyter.org/v1alpha1` CRD API contract. There is no compile-time or runtime dependency on the Go controller.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React 19, Vite, MUI v7, React Query (TanStack), React Router v7, CSS Modules
- Backend: Bun, TypeScript, @kubernetes/client-node
- Build: `bun run build:full` (tsc + vite build)
- Lint: `bun run lint` (eslint)
- Format: `bun run format` (prettier)
- Container: `make docker-build` (finch/docker)
- Pre-commit: husky + lint-staged (auto-formats and lints staged files)

## Common Commands

```bash
bun install              # Install dependencies
bun run dev:full         # Start both frontend (:5173) and backend (:8090)
bun run dev              # Frontend only (Vite)
bun run dev:server       # Backend only (Bun --watch)
bun run build:full       # Full build (tsc + vite)
bun run lint             # ESLint
bun run format           # Prettier (write)
bun run format:check     # Prettier (check only)
make refresh-token       # Fetch OIDC token for local dev (creates .env)
make deploy-kind         # Build + deploy to local Kind cluster
make deploy-aws          # Build + push to ECR + deploy to EKS
make help                # Show all Makefile targets
```

## Makefile Targets

```bash
make build               # Build frontend + server (bun run build:full)
make docker-build        # Build container image
make docker-push         # Push container image
make deploy-kind         # Build + load image into Kind cluster + restart
make deploy-aws          # Build + push to ECR + restart deployment
make load-image-aws      # Build + push to ECR (no restart)
make kubectl-aws         # Switch kubectl to EKS context
make refresh-token       # Fetch fresh OIDC token for local dev
make clean               # Remove build artifacts
make info                # Show current configuration
make help                # Show all targets
```

## Key Conventions

- All server code lives in `server/`, all frontend code in `src/`
- TypeScript strict mode everywhere — avoid `any`, use proper types
- CSS Modules for component styles (`.module.css`)
- React Query for server state, React Context for UI state (auth, theme)
- K8s types in `server/types.ts` mirror the CRD spec — update these if the CRD changes
- Frontend types in `src/types/workspace.ts` — keep in sync with server types
- UI strings centralized in `src/constants/strings.ts`
- Never log tokens or sensitive data
- `.env` is gitignored and must never be committed
- K8s resource names: lowercase alphanumeric + hyphens, 1-253 chars
- Commit prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`
- Branch naming: `feature/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `refactor/`

## Architecture Notes

- Auth flow: Browser -> Traefik -> OAuth2 Proxy -> Web App (Bun) -> K8s API Server
- In dev mode, backend reads `DEV_ACCESS_TOKEN` from `.env` instead of OAuth2 Proxy header
- K8s clients are cached per JWT hash (10min TTL, max 100 clients)
- React Query polls workspace list every 60s; detail polls every 3s while transitioning
- Workspace ownership tracked via `workspace.jupyter.org/created-by` annotation
- Vite proxies `/api` to `http://localhost:8090` in dev mode

## Testing

### Commands

```bash
bun run test             # Full unit suite (server + client)
bun run test:server      # Server tests only
bun run test:client      # Frontend tests only
```

### Two environments, two bunfigs

The repo deliberately splits test environments:

- **`bunfig.toml`** (root) — no preload. Server tests use Bun's native `Request`/`Response`. happy-dom strips forbidden headers like `Origin` and `Referer`, which the CSRF layer depends on, so we do **not** register happy-dom for server tests.
- **`src/bunfig.toml`** — preloads `src/test-dom-setup.ts`, which registers happy-dom globals so React components can render. `screen` from `@testing-library/react` binds to `document.body` at module-load time, so the preload must run before any test imports.

When adding a new test:

- Server test → put it in `server/__tests__/` — no DOM, no React imports
- Frontend test → colocate next to the source (`src/**/*.test.ts` or `*.test.tsx`) — DOM is auto-available via preload
- E2E test → goes in `e2e/` (separate config, see E2E section when it's added)

### Writing tests that earn their keep

**Rule: each test should fail for a distinct reason.** If two tests would fail from the same bug, one is redundant. Aim for breadth across failure modes, not depth on one.

- Test each branch of a lookup table / status-code mapping (each is a separate contract)
- Test defensive defaults where `undefined` would cause a runtime `TypeError` downstream
- Test suffix-matching, ordering, and timing invariants (non-obvious logic)
- Use `test.each` for parameterized cases that truly differ in input
- Don't test `JSON.stringify` / `new Response` — that's testing the stdlib
- Don't write "accepts X" + "accepts Y" + "accepts Z" if they all hit the same branch
- Don't test presentational components (layout, static text, icons) — E2E covers these
- Don't add a test that would still pass if you deleted the body of the function being tested

**For React component tests:** always call `cleanup()` in `beforeEach` — happy-dom's `document.body` persists across tests and `screen.getBy*` will find duplicate elements otherwise. `renderHook` doesn't need this; `render` does.

### What to test when making changes

- Server handler → distinct error paths + response shape
- Pure utility (`parseQuantity`, `getWorkspaceState`, etc.) → the new branch you just added
- React Query hook → optimistic update + rollback on error
- Auth/session/CSRF logic → these are the highest-value tests; cover failure modes, not just happy path
- CRD type in `server/types.ts` → update `server/__tests__/k8s.test.ts` mappers

### What NOT to bother testing

- Layout/presentational React components (`Layout`, `ThemeSwitcher`, `ConfirmDialog`, `TemplateCard`)
- Thin wrappers over framework primitives
- Getters that return a field directly
- Code paths the type system already guarantees

## Local Development Setup

1. `make refresh-token` (creates `.env` and fetches a fresh OIDC token via browser auth)
2. `bun install`
3. `bun run dev:full` (starts both Vite on :5173 and Bun server on :8090)

If API calls return 401, the token has expired — re-run `make refresh-token`.
